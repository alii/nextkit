# nextkit

nextkit is a toolkit for Next.js apps that lets you generate type-safe, error handled Next.js API routes that conform to a standard response type.

### example

My recommended pattern can be found in the `example` folder. This file exports a _type_ that can be ambiently imported in the frontend to have a guaranteed type for the API (plus, you can wrap it with the type `APIResponse<T>` to have the actual json typed from the HTTP response).

### docs

honestly the examples folder is good enough and it demonstrates all the features. i have no motivation to write docs yet ðŸš€ðŸš€
